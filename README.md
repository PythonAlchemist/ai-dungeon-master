# ai-dungeon-master

- Design a combat system for AI Dungeon that doesn't suck. It can't rely solely on the LLM but should communicate with the LLM to get the best possible results. The system needs to handle movement, combat order, and combat resolution. It should also be able to handle multiple combatants at once. Reporting back to the LLM after each action for narration.
- Interface with Diffision Models to create images for the LLM to use in the story.
